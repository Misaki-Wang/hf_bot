  "abstract": "Covo-Audio is a 7B-parameter end-to-end large audio language model that processes continuous audio inputs and generates audio outputs, achieving state-of-the-art performance across speech-text modeling, spoken dialogue, and full-duplex voice interaction tasks through large-scale pretraining and post-training techniques. In this work, we present Covo-Audio, a 7B-parameter end-to-end LALM that directly processes continuous audio inputs and generates audio outputs within a single unified architecture. Through large-scale curated pretraining and targeted post-training , Covo-Audio achieves state-of-the-art or competitive performance among models of comparable scale across a broad spectrum of tasks, including speech-text modeling , spoken dialogue , speech understanding , audio understanding , and full-duplex voice interaction . Extensive evaluations demonstrate that the pretrained foundation model exhibits strong speech-text comprehension and semantic reasoning capabilities on multiple benchmarks, outperforming representative open-source models of comparable scale. Furthermore, Covo-Audio-Chat, the dialogue-oriented variant , demonstrates strong spoken conversational abilities , including understanding, contextual reasoning , instruction following , and generating contextually appropriate and empathetic responses , validating its applicability to real-world conversational assistant scenarios. Covo-Audio-Chat-FD, the evolved full-duplex model , achieves substantially superior performance on both spoken dialogue capabilities and full-duplex interaction behaviors, demonstrating its competence in practical robustness. To mitigate the high cost of deploying end-to-end LALM s for natural conversational systems, we propose an intelligence-speaker decoupling strategy that separates dialogue intelligence from voice rendering , enabling flexible voice customization with minimal text-to-speech (TTS) data while preserving dialogue performance. Overall, our results highlight the strong potential of 7B-scale models to integrate sophisticated audio intelligence with high-level semantic reasoning , and suggest a scalable path toward more capable and versatile LALMs.",
