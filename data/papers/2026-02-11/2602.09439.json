  "abstract": "A large-scale, high-quality, and fully open dataset for text-to-image fine-tuning is presented, featuring over 6 million text-image pairs with rigorous filtering for alignment and quality across multiple task combinations and visual styles. High-quality and open datasets remain a major bottleneck for text-to-image (T2I) fine-tuning . Despite rapid progress in model architectures and training pipelines, most publicly available fine-tuning datasets suffer from low resolution, poor text-image alignment , or limited diversity, resulting in a clear performance gap between open research models and enterprise-grade models. In this work, we present Fine-T2I, a large-scale, high-quality, and fully open dataset for T2I fine-tuning . Fine-T2I spans 10 task combinations, 32 prompt categories, 11 visual styles, and 5 prompt templates, and combines synthetic images generated by strong modern models with carefully curated real images from professional photographers. All samples are rigorously filtered for text-image alignment , visual fidelity , and prompt quality , with over 95% of initial candidates removed. The final dataset contains over 6 million text-image pairs, around 2 TB on disk, approaching the scale of pretraining datasets while maintaining fine-tuning -level quality. Across a diverse set of pretrained diffusion and autoregressive models , fine-tuning on Fine-T2I consistently improves both generation quality and instruction adherence, as validated by human evaluation, visual comparison, and automatic metrics. We release Fine-T2I under an open license to help close the data gap in T2I fine-tuning in the open community.",
