  "abstract": "LatentLens enables interpretation of visual token representations in vision-language models by comparing them to contextualized textual representations, revealing that visual tokens are more interpretable than previously thought. Transforming a large language model ( LLM ) into a Vision-Language Model (VLM) can be achieved by mapping the visual tokens from a vision encoder into the embedding space of an LLM . Intriguingly, this mapping can be as simple as a shallow MLP transformation . To understand why LLM s can so readily process visual tokens , we need interpretability methods that reveal what is encoded in the visual token representations at every layer of LLM processing. In this work, we introduce LatentLens, a novel approach for mapping latent representations to descriptions in natural language. LatentLens works by encoding a large text corpus and storing contextualized token representations for each token in that corpus. Visual token representations are then compared to their contextualized textual representations, with the top-k nearest neighbor representations providing descriptions of the visual token. We evaluate this method on 10 different VLMs, showing that commonly used methods, such as LogitLens, substantially underestimate the interpretability of visual tokens . With LatentLens instead, the majority of visual tokens are interpretable across all studied models and all layers. Qualitatively, we show that the descriptions produced by LatentLens are semantically meaningful and provide more fine-grained interpretations for humans compared to individual tokens. More broadly, our findings contribute new evidence on the alignment between vision and language representations, opening up new directions for analyzing latent representations .",
