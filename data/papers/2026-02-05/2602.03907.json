  "abstract": "HY3D-Bench presents an open-source ecosystem for 3D content creation that provides high-fidelity 3D objects and synthetic assets to advance 3D generation capabilities. While recent advances in neural representations and generative models have revolutionized 3D content creation , the field remains constrained by significant data processing bottlenecks. To address this, we introduce HY3D-Bench, an open-source ecosystem designed to establish a unified, high-quality foundation for 3D generation . Our contributions are threefold: (1) We curate a library of 250k high-fidelity 3D objects distilled from large-scale repositories, employing a rigorous pipeline to deliver training-ready artifacts, including watertight meshes and multi-view renderings ; (2) We introduce structured part-level decomposition , providing the granularity essential for fine-grained perception and controllable editing; and (3) We bridge real-world distribution gaps via a scalable AIGC synthesis pipeline , contributing 125k synthetic assets to enhance diversity in long-tail categories. Validated empirically through the training of Hunyuan3D-2.1-Small, HY3D-Bench democratizes access to robust data resources, aiming to catalyze innovation across 3D perception , robotics , and digital content creation .",
