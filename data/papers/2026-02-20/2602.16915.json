  "abstract": "StereoAdapter-2 improves underwater stereo depth estimation by replacing ConvGRU with a selective state space ConvSS2D operator for efficient long-range propagation and introduces a large-scale synthetic underwater dataset. Stereo depth estimation is fundamental to underwater robotic perception , yet suffers from severe domain shift s caused by wavelength-dependent light attenuation , scattering , and refraction . Recent approaches leverage monocular foundation models with GRU-based iterative refinement for underwater adaptation; however, the sequential gating and local convolutional kernels in GRUs necessitate multiple iterations for long-range disparity propagation , limiting performance in large-disparity and textureless underwater regions. In this paper, we propose StereoAdapter-2, which replaces the conventional ConvGRU updater with a novel ConvSS2D operator based on selective state space models . The proposed operator employs a four-directional scanning strategy that naturally aligns with epipolar geometry while capturing vertical structural consistency, enabling efficient long-range spatial propagation within a single update step at linear computational complexity. Furthermore, we construct UW-StereoDepth-80K, a large-scale synthetic underwater stereo dataset featuring diverse baselines, attenuation coefficients, and scattering parameters through a two-stage generative pipeline combining semantic-aware style transfer and geometry-consistent novel view synthesis. Combined with dynamic LoRA adaptation inherited from StereoAdapter, our framework achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on underwater benchmarks with 17% improvement on TartanAir-UW and 7.2% improvment on SQUID , with real-world validation on the BlueROV2 platform demonstrates the robustness of our approach.
