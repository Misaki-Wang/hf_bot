  "abstract": "Flow matching models for text-to-image generation are enhanced through a reinforcement learning framework that addresses sample inefficiency and prompt overfitting by incorporating language models for prompt refinement, achieving superior performance with reduced computational requirements. Flow matching models (FMs) have revolutionized text-to-image (T2I) generation, with reinforcement learning (RL) serving as a critical post-training strategy for alignment with reward objectives. In this research, we show that current RL pipelines for FMs suffer from two underappreciated yet important limitations: sample inefficiency due to insufficient generation diversity, and pronounced prompt overfitting , where models memorize specific training formulations and exhibit dramatic performance collapse when evaluated on semantically equivalent but stylistically varied prompts. We present PromptRL (Prompt Matters in RL for Flow-Based Image Generation), a framework that incorporates language models (LMs) as trainable prompt refinement agents directly within the flow-based RL optimization loop. This design yields two complementary benefits: rapid development of sophisticated prompt rewriting capabilities and, critically, a synergistic training regime that reshapes the optimization dynamics. PromptRL achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks, obtaining scores of 0.97 on GenEval , 0.98 on OCR accuracy , and 24.05 on PickScore . Furthermore, we validate the effectiveness of our RL approach on large-scale image editing models, improving the EditReward of FLUX.1-Kontext from 1.19 to 1.43 with only 0.06 million rollouts, surpassing Gemini 2.5 Flash Image (also known as Nano Banana), which scores 1.37, and achieving comparable performance with ReasonNet (1.44), which relied on fine-grained data annotations along with a complex multi-stage training. Our extensive experiments empirically demonstrate that PromptRL consistently achieves higher performance ceilings while requiring over 2times fewer rollouts compared to naive flow-only RL.
