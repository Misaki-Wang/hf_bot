  "abstract": "Loop-ViT introduces a recursive vision transformer architecture that decouples reasoning depth from model capacity through weight-tied recurrence and dynamic exit mechanisms, achieving superior visual reasoning performance with fewer parameters. Recent advances in visual reasoning have leveraged vision transformers to tackle the ARC-AGI benchmark . However, we argue that the feed-forward architecture , where computational depth is strictly bound to parameter size, falls short of capturing the iterative, algorithmic nature of human induction. In this work, we propose a recursive architecture called Loop-ViT, which decouples reasoning depth from model capacity through weight-tied recurrence . Loop-ViT iterates a weight-tied Hybrid Block , combining local convolutions and global attention , to form a latent chain of thought . Crucially, we introduce a parameter-free Dynamic Exit mechanism based on predictive entropy : the model halts inference when its internal state ``crystallizes\" into a low-uncertainty attractor. Empirical results on the ARC-AGI-1 benchmark validate this perspective: our 18M model achieves 65.8% accuracy, outperforming massive 73M-parameter ensembles. These findings demonstrate that adaptive iterative computation offers a far more efficient scaling axis for visual reasoning than simply increasing network width.
