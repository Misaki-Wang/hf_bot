  "abstract": "TRIP-Bench presents a comprehensive long-horizon benchmark for travel planning that evaluates LLM agents on complex multi-turn interactions, while GTPO offers an online reinforcement learning approach to enhance constraint satisfaction and robustness in extended dialogues. As LLM-based agents are deployed in increasingly complex real-world settings, existing benchmarks underrepresent key challenges such as enforcing global constraints, coordinating multi-tool reasoning, and adapting to evolving user behavior over long, multi-turn interactions . To bridge this gap, we introduce TRIP-Bench, a long-horizon benchmark grounded in realistic travel-planning scenarios . TRIP-Bench leverages real-world data, offers 18 curated tools and 40+ travel requirements, and supports automated evaluation . It includes splits of varying difficulty; the hard split emphasizes long and ambiguous interactions, style shifts, feasibility changes, and iterative version revision. Dialogues span up to 15 user turns, can involve 150+ tool calls, and may exceed 200k tokens of context. Experiments show that even advanced models achieve at most 50\\% success on the easy split, with performance dropping below 10\\% on hard subsets. We further propose GTPO, an online multi-turn reinforcement learning method with specialized reward normalization and reward differencing . Applied to Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct , GTPO improves constraint satisfaction and interaction robustness, outperforming Gemini-3-Pro in our evaluation. We expect TRIP-Bench to advance practical long-horizon interactive agents, and GTPO to provide an effective online RL recipe for robust long-horizon training.",
