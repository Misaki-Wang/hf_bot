  "abstract": "A Japanese financial language understanding benchmark named Ebisu is introduced, featuring two expert-annotated tasks that evaluate implicit commitment recognition and hierarchical financial terminology extraction, revealing persistent challenges for current language models despite their advanced capabilities. Japanese finance combines agglutinative, head-final linguistic structure , mixed writing systems, and high-context communication norms that rely on indirect expression and implicit commitment , posing a substantial challenge for LLMs. We introduce Ebisu, a benchmark for native Japanese financial language understanding, comprising two linguistically and culturally grounded, expert-annotated tasks: JF-ICR, which evaluates implicit commitment and refusal recognition in investor-facing Q&A , and JF-TE, which assesses hierarchical extraction and ranking of nested financial terminology from professional disclosures . We evaluate a diverse set of open-source and proprietary LLMs spanning general-purpose, Japanese-adapted, and financial models. Results show that even state-of-the-art systems struggle on both tasks. While increased model scale yields limited improvements, language- and domain-specific adaptation does not reliably improve performance, leaving substantial gaps unresolved. Ebisu provides a focused benchmark for advancing linguistically and culturally grounded financial NLP. All datasets and evaluation scripts are publicly released.",
