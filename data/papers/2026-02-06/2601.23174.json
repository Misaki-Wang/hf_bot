  "abstract": "DyCAST is a dynamic speech tokenizer that uses soft character-level alignment and duration modeling to enable variable-frame-rate tokenization, improving speech resynthesis quality with fewer tokens than traditional fixed-frame-rate codecs. Neural audio codecs are at the core of modern conversational speech technologies , converting continuous speech into sequences of discrete tokens that can be processed by LLMs . However, existing codecs typically operate at fixed frame rates , allocating tokens uniformly in time and producing unnecessarily long sequences. In this work, we introduce DyCAST, a Dynamic Character-Aligned Speech Tokenizer that enables variable-frame-rate tokenization through soft character-level alignment and explicit duration modeling . DyCAST learns to associate tokens with character-level linguistic units during training and supports alignment-free inference with direct control over token durations at decoding time. To improve speech resynthesis quality at low frame rates, we further introduce a retrieval-augmented decoding mechanism that enhances reconstruction fidelity without increasing bitrate. Experiments show that DyCAST achieves competitive speech resynthesis quality and downstream performance while using significantly fewer tokens than fixed-frame-rate codecs. Code and checkpoints will be released publicly at https://github.com/lucadellalib/dycast.",
