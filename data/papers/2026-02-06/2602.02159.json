  "abstract": "Focus-dLLM introduces a training-free attention sparsification framework that improves inference efficiency for long-context diffusion large language models by predicting unmasked regions and pruning redundant attention computations. Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) deliver strong long-context processing capability in a non-autoregressive decoding paradigm. However, the considerable computational cost of bidirectional full attention limits the inference efficiency. Although sparse attention is promising, existing methods remain ineffective. This stems from the need to estimate attention importance for tokens yet to be decoded, while the unmasked token positions are unknown during diffusion. In this paper, we present Focus-dLLM, a novel training-free attention sparsification framework tailored for accurate and efficient long-context dLLM inference. Based on the finding that token confidence strongly correlates across adjacent steps, we first design a past confidence-guided indicator to predict unmasked regions. Built upon this, we propose a sink-aware pruning strategy to accurately estimate and remove redundant attention computation, while preserving highly influential attention sinks . To further reduce overhead, this strategy reuses identified sink locations across layers, leveraging the observed cross-layer consistency . Experimental results show that our method offers more than 29times lossless speedup under 32K context length. The code is publicly available at: https://github.com/Longxmas/Focus-dLLM",
