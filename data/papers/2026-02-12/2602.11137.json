  "abstract": "Pretraining with larger weight decay values improves model plasticity and downstream fine-tuning performance by encouraging linearly separable representations and reducing overfitting. The prevailing paradigm in large language model (LLM) development is to pretrain a base model, then perform further training to improve performance and model behavior. However, hyperparameter optimization and scaling laws have been studied primarily from the perspective of the base model's validation loss, ignoring downstream adaptability. In this work, we study pretraining from the perspective of model plasticity , that is, the ability of the base model to successfully adapt to downstream tasks through fine-tuning . We focus on the role of weight decay , a key regularization parameter during pretraining . Through systematic experiments, we show that models trained with larger weight decay values are more plastic, meaning they show larger performance gains when fine-tuned on downstream tasks. This phenomenon can lead to counterintuitive trade-offs where base models that perform worse after pretraining can perform better after fine-tuning . Further investigation of weight decay 's mechanistic effects on model behavior reveals that it encourages linearly separable representations, regularizes attention matrices , and reduces overfitting on the training data. In conclusion, this work demonstrates the importance of using evaluation metrics beyond cross-entropy loss for hyperparameter optimization and casts light on the multifaceted role of that a single optimization hyperparameter plays in shaping model behavior.",
