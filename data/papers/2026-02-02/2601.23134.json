  "abstract": "A Bayesian Optimization approach using Gaussian Processes automates scheduling configuration optimization on heterogeneous multi-core systems while approximating the Pareto Frontier for energy-time trade-offs. In the post-Dennard era, optimizing embedded systems requires navigating complex trade-offs between energy efficiency and latency. Traditional heuristic tuning is often inefficient in such high-dimensional, non-smooth landscapes. In this work, we propose a Bayesian Optimization framework using Gaussian Processes to automate the search for optimal scheduling configurations on heterogeneous multi-core architectures. We explicitly address the multi-objective nature of the problem by approximating the Pareto Frontier between energy and time. Furthermore, by incorporating Sensitivity Analysis ( fANOVA ) and comparing different covariance kernels (e.g., Matérn vs. RBF ), we provide physical interpretability to the black-box model, revealing the dominant hardware parameters driving system performance.",
