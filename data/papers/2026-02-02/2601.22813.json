  "abstract": "Quantized training method Quartet II improves NVFP4 format utilization for large language model pre-training through enhanced gradient estimation and faster GPU execution. The NVFP4 lower-precision format, supported in hardware by NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs , promises to allow, for the first time, end-to-end fully-quantized pre-training of massive models such as LLMs. Yet, existing quantized training methods still sacrifice some of the representation capacity of this format in favor of more accurate unbiased quantized gradient estimation by stochastic rounding (SR), losing noticeable accuracy relative to standard FP16 and FP8 training. In this paper, improve the state of the art for quantized training in NVFP4 via a novel unbiased quantization routine for micro-scaled formats , called MS-EDEN , that has more than 2x lower quantization error than SR. We integrate it into a novel fully- NVFP4 quantization scheme for linear layers , called Quartet II . We show analytically that Quartet II achieves consistently better gradient estimation across all major matrix multiplications , both on the forward and on the backward passes. In addition, our proposal synergizes well with recent training improvements aimed specifically at NVFP4 . We further validate Quartet II on end-to-end LLM training with up to 1.9B parameters on 38B tokens. We provide kernels for execution on NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs with up to 4.2x speedup over BF16.
