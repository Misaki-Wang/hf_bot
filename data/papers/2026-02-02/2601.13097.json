  "abstract": "RM-RF is a lightweight reward model that predicts execution outcomes from source code alone, offering faster and more cost-effective evaluation than traditional compile-and-run methods. We present RM-RF, a lightweight reward model for run-free evaluation of automatically generated unit tests . Instead of repeatedly compiling and executing candidate tests, RM-RF predicts - from source and test code alone - three execution-derived signals : (1) whether the augmented test suite compiles and runs successfully, (2) whether the generated test cases increase code coverage , and (3) whether the generated test cases improve the mutation kill rate . To train and evaluate RM-RF we assemble a multilingual dataset (Java, Python, Go) of focal files , test files , and candidate test additions labeled by an execution-based pipeline , and we release an associated dataset and methodology for comparative evaluation. We tested multiple model families and tuning regimes ( zero-shot , full fine-tuning , and PEFT via LoRA ), achieving an average F1 of 0.69 across the three targets. Compared to conventional compile-and-run instruments, RM-RF provides substantially lower latency and infrastructure cost while delivering competitive predictive fidelity, enabling fast, scalable feedback for large-scale test generation and RL-based code optimization.",
