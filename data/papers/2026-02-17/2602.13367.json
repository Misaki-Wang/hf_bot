  "abstract": "Nanbeige4.1-3B is a 3B-parameter unified language model that demonstrates superior performance in agentic behavior, code generation, and reasoning compared to larger models through advanced reward modeling and training techniques. We present Nanbeige4.1-3B, a unified generalist language model that simultaneously achieves strong agentic behavior , code generation , and general reasoning with only 3B parameters. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first open-source small language model (SLM) to achieve such versatility in a single model. To improve reasoning and preference alignment, we combine point-wise and pair-wise reward modeling , ensuring high-quality, human-aligned responses . For code generation , we design complexity-aware rewards in Reinforcement Learning , optimizing both correctness and efficiency. In deep search , we perform complex data synthesis and incorporate turn-level supervision during training. This enables stable long-horizon tool interactions, allowing Nanbeige4.1-3B to reliably execute up to 600 tool-call turns for complex problem-solving. Extensive experimental results show that Nanbeige4.1-3B significantly outperforms prior models of similar scale, such as Nanbeige4-3B-2511 and Qwen3-4B, even achieving superior performance compared to much larger models, such as Qwen3-30B-A3B. Our results demonstrate that small models can achieve both broad competence and strong specialization simultaneously, redefining the potential of 3B parameter models.",
