  "abstract": "The DLT-Corpus dataset, containing 2.98 billion tokens from diverse sources, enables analysis of technology emergence patterns and market-innovation correlations in the distributed ledger technology sector. We introduce DLT-Corpus, the largest domain-specific text collection for Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) research to date: 2.98 billion tokens from 22.12 million documents spanning scientific literature (37,440 publications), United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) patents (49,023 filings), and social media (22 million posts). Existing Natural Language Processing (NLP) resources for DLT focus narrowly on cryptocurrencies price prediction and smart contracts, leaving domain-specific language under explored despite the sector's ~$3 trillion market capitalization and rapid technological evolution. We demonstrate DLT-Corpus' utility by analyzing technology emergence patterns and market-innovation correlations. Findings reveal that technologies originate in scientific literature before reaching patents and social media, following traditional technology transfer patterns . While social media sentiment remains overwhelmingly bullish even during crypto winters, scientific and patent activity grow independently of market fluctuations, tracking overall market expansion in a virtuous cycle where research precedes and enables economic growth that funds further innovation. We publicly release the full DLT-Corpus; LedgerBERT , a domain-adapted model achieving 23% improvement over BERT-base on a DLT-specific Named Entity Recognition (NER) task; and all associated tools and code.",
