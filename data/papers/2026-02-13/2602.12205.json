  "abstract": "A lightweight 5B unified multimodal model achieves competitive performance through hierarchical feature extraction, learnable think tokens, and progressive training strategies including alignment pre-training, joint supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning with MR-GRPO. Current unified multimodal models for image generation and editing typically rely on massive parameter scale s (e.g., >10B), entailing prohibitive training costs and deployment footprints. In this work, we present DeepGen 1.0, a lightweight 5B unified model that achieves comprehensive capabilities competitive with or surpassing much larger counterparts. To overcome the limitations of compact models in semantic understanding and fine-grained control, we introduce Stacked Channel Bridging (SCB), a deep alignment framework that extracts hierarchical features from multiple VLM layers and fuses them with learnable ' think tokens ' to provide the generative backbone with structured, reasoning-rich guidance. We further design a data-centric training strategy spanning three progressive stages: (1) Alignment Pre-training on large-scale image-text pairs and editing triplets to synchronize VLM and DiT representations , (2) Joint Supervised Fine-tuning on a high-quality mixture of generation, editing, and reasoning tasks to foster omni-capabilities, and (3) Reinforcement Learning with MR-GRPO , which leverages a mixture of reward functions and supervision signals, resulting in substantial gains in generation quality and alignment with human preferences , while maintaining stable training progress and avoiding visual artifacts . Despite being trained on only ~50M samples, DeepGen 1.0 achieves leading performance across diverse benchmarks, surpassing the 80B HunyuanImage by 28% on WISE and the 27B Qwen-Image-Edit by 37% on UniREditBench. By open-sourcing our training code, weights, and datasets, we provide an efficient, high-performance alternative to democratize unified multimodal research.",
