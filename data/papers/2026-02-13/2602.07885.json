  "abstract": "MemFly addresses the challenge of long-term memory in language models by using information bottleneck principles to create an adaptive memory structure with hybrid retrieval mechanisms for improved task performance. Long-term memory enables large language model agents to tackle complex tasks through historical interactions. However, existing frameworks encounter a fundamental dilemma between compressing redundant information efficiently and maintaining precise retrieval for downstream tasks. To bridge this gap, we propose MemFly, a framework grounded in information bottleneck principles that facilitates on-the-fly memory evolution for LLMs. Our approach minimizes compression entropy while maximizing relevance entropy via a gradient-free optimizer, constructing a stratified memory structure for efficient storage. To fully leverage MemFly, we develop a hybrid retrieval mechanism that seamlessly integrates semantic, symbolic, and topological pathways, incorporating iterative refinement to handle complex multi-hop queries. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that MemFly substantially outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in memory coherence , response fidelity , and accuracy.",
