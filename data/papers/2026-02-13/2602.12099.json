  "abstract": "A vision-language-action model enhanced with world model-based reinforcement learning demonstrates improved performance and long-horizon execution capabilities for robotic manipulation tasks. Vision-language-action (VLA) models that directly predict multi-step action chunks from current observations face inherent limitations due to constrained scene understanding and weak future anticipation capabilities. In contrast, video world models pre-trained on web-scale video corpora exhibit robust spatiotemporal reasoning and accurate future prediction, making them a natural foundation for enhancing VLA learning. Therefore, we propose GigaBrain-0.5M*, a VLA model trained via world model-based reinforcement learning . Built upon GigaBrain-0.5, which is pre-trained on over 10,000 hours of robotic manipulation data, whose intermediate version currently ranks first on the international RoboChallenge benchmark . GigaBrain-0.5M* further integrates world model-based reinforcement learning via RAMP ( Reinforcement leArning via world Model-conditioned Policy) to enable robust cross-task adaptation . Empirical results demonstrate that RAMP achieves substantial performance gains over the RECAP baseline, yielding improvements of approximately 30\\% on challenging tasks including Laundry Folding, Box Packing, and Espresso Preparation. Critically, GigaBrain-0.5M^* exhibits reliable long-horizon execution, consistently accomplishing complex manipulation tasks without failure as validated by real-world deployment videos on our https://gigabrain05m.github.io{project page}.",
