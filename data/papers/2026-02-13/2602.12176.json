  "abstract": "Single-minus tree-level n-gluon scattering amplitudes are reconsidered. Often presumed to vanish, they are shown here to be nonvanishing for certain \"half-collinear\" configurations existing in Klein space or for complexified momenta. We derive a piecewise-constant closed-form expression for the decay of a single minus-helicity gluon into n-1 plus-helicity gluons as a function of their momenta. This formula nontrivially satisfies multiple consistency conditions including Weinberg's soft theorem.",
