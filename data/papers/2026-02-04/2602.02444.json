  "abstract": "RANKVIDEO is a reasoning-based video retrieval system that improves upon traditional two-stage frameworks through explicit query-video pair analysis and a multi-objective training approach. Reranking is a critical component of modern retrieval systems, which typically pair an efficient first-stage retriever with a more expressive model to refine results. While large reasoning models have driven rapid progress in text-centric reranking , reasoning-based reranking for video retrieval remains underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce RANKVIDEO, a reasoning-based reranker for video retrieval that explicitly reasons over query-video pairs using video content to assess relevance. RANKVIDEO is trained using a two-stage curriculum consisting of perception-grounded supervised fine-tuning followed by reranking training that combines pointwise , pairwise , and teacher confidence distillation objectives, and is supported by a data synthesis pipeline for constructing reasoning-intensive query-video pairs. Experiments on the large-scale MultiVENT 2.0 benchmark demonstrate that RANKVIDEO consistently improves retrieval performance within a two-stage framework, yielding an average improvement of 31% on nDCG@10 and outperforming text-only and vision-language reranking alternatives, while more efficient.",
