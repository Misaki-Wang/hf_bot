  "abstract": "Multimodal Memory Agent (MMA) improves long-horizon agent performance by dynamically scoring memory reliability and handling visual biases in retrieval-augmented systems. Long-horizon multimodal agents depend on external memory ; however, similarity-based retrieval often surfaces stale, low-credibility, or conflicting items, which can trigger overconfident errors. We propose Multimodal Memory Agent (MMA), which assigns each retrieved memory item a dynamic reliability score by combining source credibility , temporal decay , and conflict-aware network consensus , and uses this signal to reweight evidence and abstain when support is insufficient. We also introduce MMA-Bench , a programmatically generated benchmark for belief dynamics with controlled speaker reliability and structured text-vision contradictions. Using this framework, we uncover the \" Visual Placebo Effect \", revealing how RAG-based agents inherit latent visual biases from foundation models. On FEVER, MMA matches baseline accuracy while reducing variance by 35.2% and improving selective utility; on LoCoMo, a safety-oriented configuration improves actionable accuracy and reduces wrong answers; on MMA-Bench , MMA reaches 41.18% Type-B accuracy in Vision mode, while the baseline collapses to 0.0% under the same protocol.
