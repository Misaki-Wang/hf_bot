  "abstract": "Research explores PDE solvers including neural frameworks for scientific simulations, examining forward solutions, inverse problems, and equation discovery across multi-variable and non-linear systems. Partial Differential Equations are precise in modelling the physical, biological and graphical phenomena. However, the numerical methods suffer from the curse of dimensionality, high computation costs and domain-specific discretization. We aim to explore pros and cons of different PDE solvers , and apply them to specific scientific simulation problems, including forwarding solution, inverse problems and equations discovery. In particular, we extend the recent CNF (NeurIPS 2023) framework solver to multi-dependent-variable and non-linear settings , together with down-stream applications. The outcomes include implementation of selected methods, self-tuning techniques, evaluation on benchmark problems and a comprehensive survey of neural PDE solvers and scientific simulation applications.",
