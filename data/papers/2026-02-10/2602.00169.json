  "abstract": "AI-driven materials science integrates large language models across discovery pipelines from data curation to agent-based experimentation, emphasizing system-level optimization and autonomous goal pursuit. The convergence of artificial intelligence and materials science presents a transformative opportunity, but achieving true acceleration in discovery requires moving beyond task-isolated, fine-tuned models toward agentic systems that plan, act, and learn across the full discovery loop. This survey advances a unique pipeline-centric view that spans from corpus curation and pretraining, through domain adaptation and instruction tuning , to goal-conditioned agents interfacing with simulation and experimental platforms . Unlike prior reviews, we treat the entire process as an end-to-end system to be optimized for tangible discovery outcomes rather than proxy benchmarks. This perspective allows us to trace how upstream design choices-such as data curation and training objectives-can be aligned with downstream experimental success through effective credit assignment . To bridge communities and establish a shared frame of reference, we first present an integrated lens that aligns terminology, evaluation, and workflow stages across AI and materials science . We then analyze the field through two focused lenses: From the AI perspective, the survey details LLM strengths in pattern recognition , predictive analytics , and natural language processing for literature mining , materials characterization , and property prediction ; from the materials science perspective, it highlights applications in materials design , process optimization , and the acceleration of computational workflows via integration with external tools (e.g., DFT , robotic labs ). Finally, we contrast passive, reactive approaches with agentic design, cataloging current contributions while motivating systems that pursue long-horizon goals with autonomy, memory, and tool use. This survey charts a practical roadmap towards autonomous, safety-aware LLM agents aimed at discovering novel and useful materials.",
