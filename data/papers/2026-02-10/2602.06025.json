  "abstract": "BudgetMem is a runtime memory framework for LLM agents that uses modular components with three budget tiers and a neural policy router to optimize performance-cost trade-offs in memory usage. Memory is increasingly central to Large Language Model (LLM) agents operating beyond a single context window, yet most existing systems rely on offline, query-agnostic memory construction that can be inefficient and may discard query-critical information. Although runtime memory utilization is a natural alternative, prior work often incurs substantial overhead and offers limited explicit control over the performance-cost trade-off. In this work, we present BudgetMem, a runtime agent memory framework for explicit, query-aware performance-cost control . BudgetMem structures memory processing as a set of memory modules , each offered in three budget tiers (i.e., Low/Mid/High). A lightweight router performs budget-tier routing across modules to balance task performance and memory construction cost, which is implemented as a compact neural policy trained with reinforcement learning . Using BudgetMem as a unified testbed, we study three complementary strategies for realizing budget tiers : implementation (method complexity), reasoning (inference behavior), and capacity (module model size). Across LoCoMo , LongMemEval , and HotpotQA , BudgetMem surpasses strong baselines when performance is prioritized (i.e., high-budget setting), and delivers better accuracy-cost frontiers under tighter budgets. Moreover, our analysis disentangles the strengths and weaknesses of different tiering strategies, clarifying when each axis delivers the most favorable trade-offs under varying budget regimes.",
