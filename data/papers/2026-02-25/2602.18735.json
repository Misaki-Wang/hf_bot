  "abstract": "LaS-Comp presents a zero-shot 3D shape completion method using 3D foundation models with a two-stage approach for faithful reconstruction and seamless boundary refinement. This paper introduces LaS-Comp, a zero-shot and category-agnostic approach that leverages the rich geometric priors of 3D foundation models to enable 3D shape completion across diverse types of partial observations. Our contributions are threefold: First, harnesses these powerful generative priors for completion through a complementary two-stage design : (i) an explicit replacement stage that preserves the partial observation geometry to ensure faithful completion; and (ii) an implicit refinement stage ensures seamless boundaries between the observed and synthesized regions. Second, our framework is training-free and compatible with different 3D foundation models . Third, we introduce Omni-Comp , a comprehensive benchmark combining real-world and synthetic data with diverse and challenging partial patterns, enabling a more thorough and realistic evaluation. Both quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches. Our code and data will be available at https://github.com/DavidYan2001/LaS-Comp{LaS-Comp}.",
