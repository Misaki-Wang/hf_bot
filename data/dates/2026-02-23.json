      "abstract": "VESPO addresses training instability in LLM reinforcement learning by using variational formulation with variance reduction to correct policy divergence without length normalization. Training stability remains a central challenge in reinforcement learning (RL) for large language models (LLMs). Policy staleness , asynchronous training , and mismatches between training and inference engines all cause the behavior policy to diverge from the current policy, risking training collapse. Importance sampling provides a principled correction for this distribution shift but suffers from high variance; existing remedies such as token-level clipping and sequence-level normalization lack a unified theoretical foundation. We propose Variational sEquence-level Soft Policy Optimization (VESPO). By incorporating variance reduction into a variational formulation over proposal distributions , VESPO derives a closed-form reshaping kernel that operates directly on sequence-level importance weights without length normalization. Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that VESPO maintains stable training under staleness ratios up to 64x and fully asynchronous execution, and delivers consistent gains across both dense and Mixture-of-Experts models .

      "abstract": "Large reasoning models can implicitly determine optimal stopping points for thinking, which SAGE-RL enhances by incorporating efficient reasoning patterns into pass@1 inference for improved accuracy and efficiency. Recent advancements in large reasoning models (LRMs) have greatly improved their capabilities on complex reasoning tasks through Long Chains of Thought (CoTs). However, this approach often results in substantial redundancy, impairing computational efficiency and causing significant delays in real-time applications. Recent studies show that longer reasoning chains are frequently uncorrelated with correctness and can even be detrimental to accuracy. In a further in-depth analysis of this phenomenon, we surprisingly uncover and empirically verify that LRMs implicitly know the appropriate time to stop thinking, while this capability is obscured by current sampling paradigms . Motivated by this, we introduce SAGE ( Self-Aware Guided Efficient Reasoning ), a novel sampling paradigm that unleashes this efficient reasoning potential. Furthermore, integrating SAGE as mixed sampling into group-based reinforcement learning (SAGE-RL) enables SAGE-RL to effectively incorporate SAGE-discovered efficient reasoning patterns into standard pass@1 inference , markedly enhancing both the reasoning accuracy and efficiency of LRMs across multiple challenging mathematical benchmarks .",

      "abstract": "Visual analogy learning via dynamic composition of learned LoRA transformation primitives enables flexible image manipulation with improved generalization over fixed adaptation modules. Visual analogy learning enables image manipulation through demonstration rather than textual description, allowing users to specify complex transformations difficult to articulate in words. Given a triplet {a, a', b}, the goal is to generate b' such that a : a' :: b : b'. Recent methods adapt text-to-image models to this task using a single Low-Rank Adaptation ( LoRA ) module, but they face a fundamental limitation: attempting to capture the diverse space of visual transformations within a fixed adaptation module constrains generalization capabilities. Inspired by recent work showing that LoRA s in constrained domains span meaningful, interpolatable semantic spaces , we propose LoRWeB, a novel approach that specializes the model for each analogy task at inference time through dynamic composition of learned transformation primitives , informally, choosing a point in a \"space of LoRA s\". We introduce two key components: (1) a learnable basis of LoRA modules, to span the space of different visual transformations, and (2) a lightweight encoder that dynamically selects and weighs these basis LoRA s based on the input analogy pair. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance and significantly improves generalization to unseen visual transformations. Our findings suggest that LoRA basis decompositions are a promising direction for flexible visual manipulation. Code and data are in https://research.nvidia.com/labs/par/lorweb",

Humans can rearrange objects in cluttered environments using egocentric perception , navigating occlusions without global coordinates. Inspired by this capability, we study long-horizon multi-object non-prehensile rearrangement for mobile robots using a single egocentric camera. We introduce EgoPush, a policy learning framework that enables egocentric, perception-driven rearrangement without relying on explicit global state estimation that often fails in dynamic scenes. EgoPush designs an object-centric latent space to encode relative spatial relations among objects, rather than absolute poses. This design enables a privileged reinforcement-learning (RL) teacher to jointly learn latent states and mobile actions from sparse keypoints, which is then distilled into a purely visual student policy . To reduce the supervision gap between the omniscient teacher and the partially observed student, we restrict the teacher's observations to visually accessible cues. This induces active perception behaviors that are recoverable from the student's viewpoint. To address long-horizon credit assignment, we decompose rearrangement into stage-level subproblems using temporally decayed, stage-local completion rewards . Extensive simulation experiments demonstrate that EgoPush significantly outperforms end-to-end RL baselines in success rate, with ablation studies validating each design choice. We further demonstrate zero-shot sim-to-real transfer on a mobile platform in the real world. Code and videos are available at https://ai4ce.github.io/EgoPush/.",

      "abstract": "A causal transformer-based variational autoencoder combined with flow matching enables real-time, spatially-aware conversational motion for embodied agents in virtual reality applications. As embodied agents become central to VR, telepresence, and digital human applications, their motion must go beyond speech-aligned gestures: agents should turn toward users, respond to their movement, and maintain natural gaze. Current methods lack this spatial awareness . We close this gap with the first real-time, fully causal method for spatially-aware conversational motion , deployable on a streaming VR headset. Given a user's position and dyadic audio, our approach produces full-body motion that aligns gestures with speech while orienting the agent according to the user. Our architecture combines a causal transformer -based VAE with interleaved latent tokens for streaming inference and a flow matching model conditioned on user trajectory and audio. To support varying gaze preferences, we introduce a gaze scoring mechanism with classifier-free guidance to decouple learning from control: the model captures natural spatial alignment from data, while users can adjust eye contact intensity at inference time. On the Embody 3D dataset, our method achieves state-of-the-art motion quality at over 300 FPS -- 3x faster than non-causal baselines -- while capturing the subtle spatial dynamics of natural conversation. We validate our approach on a live VR system, bringing spatially-aware conversational agents to real-time deployment. Please see https://evonneng.github.io/sarah/ for details.",

      "abstract": "A video segmentation model eliminates specialized tracking modules by using a Vision Transformer encoder with query propagation and fusion mechanisms for efficient, high-speed processing. Existing online video segmentation models typically combine a per-frame segmenter with complex specialized tracking modules. While effective, these modules introduce significant architectural complexity and computational overhead. Recent studies suggest that plain Vision Transformer (ViT) encoders, when scaled with sufficient capacity and large-scale pre-training, can conduct accurate image segmentation without requiring specialized modules. Motivated by this observation, we propose the Video Encoder-only Mask Transformer (VidEoMT), a simple encoder-only video segmentation model that eliminates the need for dedicated tracking modules. To enable temporal modeling in an encoder-only ViT, VidEoMT introduces a lightweight query propagation mechanism that carries information across frames by reusing queries from the previous frame. To balance this with adaptability to new content, it employs a query fusion strategy that combines the propagated queries with a set of temporally-agnostic learned queries. As a result, VidEoMT attains the benefits of a tracker without added complexity, achieving competitive accuracy while being 5x--10x faster, running at up to 160 FPS with a ViT-L backbone.

      "abstract": "Reinforcement learning policies are improved by using action Jacobian penalty to eliminate unrealistic high-frequency signals, with a new Linear Policy Net architecture reducing computational overhead while enabling faster convergence and efficient inference for motion imitation tasks. Reinforcement learning provides a framework for learning control policies that can reproduce diverse motions for simulated characters. However, such policies often exploit unnatural high-frequency signals that are unachievable by humans or physical robots, making them poor representations of real-world behaviors. Existing work addresses this issue by adding a reward term that penalizes a large change in actions over time. This term often requires substantial tuning efforts. We propose to use the action Jacobian penalty , which penalizes changes in action with respect to the changes in simulated state directly through auto differentiation . This effectively eliminates unrealistic high-frequency control signals without task specific tuning. While effective, the action Jacobian penalty introduces significant computational overhead when used with traditional fully connected neural network architectures. To mitigate this, we introduce a new architecture called a Linear Policy Net (LPN) that significantly reduces the computational burden for calculating the action Jacobian penalty during training. In addition, a LPN requires no parameter tuning, exhibits faster learning convergence compared to baseline methods, and can be more efficiently queried during inference time compared to a fully connected neural network . We demonstrate that a Linear Policy Net , combined with the action Jacobian penalty , is able to learn policies that generate smooth signals while solving a number of motion imitation tasks with different characteristics, including dynamic motions such as a backflip and various challenging parkour skills. Finally, we apply this approach to create policies for dynamic motions on a physical quadrupedal robot equipped with an arm.",

Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) incur high inference cost due to iterative denoising , motivating efficient pruning . Existing pruning heuristics largely inherited from autoregressive (AR) LLMs, typically preserve attention sink tokens because AR sinks serve as stable global anchors. We show that this assumption does not hold for DLMs: the attention-sink position exhibits substantially higher variance over the full generation trajectory (measured by how the dominant sink locations shift across timesteps), indicating that sinks are often transient and less structurally essential than in AR models. Based on this observation, we propose {bf Sink-Aware Pruning }, which automatically identifies and prunes unstable sinks in DLMs (prior studies usually keep sinks for AR LLMs). Without retraining, our method achieves a better quality-efficiency trade-off and outperforms strong prior pruning baselines under matched compute.

Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved remarkable progress, yet they often suffer from language bias , producing answers without relying on visual evidence. While prior work attempts to mitigate this issue through decoding strategies, architectural modifications, or curated instruction data, they typically lack a quantitative measure of how much individual training samples or tokens actually benefit from the image. In this work, we introduce Visual Information Gain (VIG), a perplexity-based metric that measures the reduction in prediction uncertainty provided by visual input. VIG enables fine-grained analysis at both sample and token levels, effectively highlighting visually grounded elements such as colors, spatial relations, and attributes. Leveraging this, we propose a VIG-guided selective training scheme that prioritizes high-VIG samples and tokens. This approach improves visual grounding and mitigates language bias , achieving superior performance with significantly reduced supervision by focusing exclusively on visually informative samples and tokens.",

Efficient stochastic optimization typically integrates an update direction that performs well in the deterministic regime with a mechanism adapting to stochastic perturbations. While Adam uses adaptive moment estimates to promote stability, Muon utilizes the weight layers' matrix structure via orthogonalized momentum , showing superior performance in large language model training. We propose a new optimizer and a diagonal extension, NAMO and NAMO-D, providing the first principled integration of orthogonalized momentum with norm-based Adam-type noise adaptation . NAMO scales orthogonalized momentum using a single adaptive stepsize, preserving orthogonality while improving upon Muon at negligible additional cost. NAMO-D instead right-multiplies orthogonalized momentum by a diagonal matrix with clamped entries. This design enables neuron-wise noise adaptation and aligns with the common near block-diagonal Hessian structure. Under standard assumptions, we establish optimal convergence rates for both algorithms in the deterministic setting and show that, in the stochastic setting, their convergence guarantees adapt to the noise level of stochastic gradients . Experiments on pretraining GPT-2 models demonstrate improved performance of both NAMO and NAMO-D compared to the Adam W and Muon baselines, with NAMO-D achieving further gains over NAMO via an additional clamping hyperparameter that balances the competing goals of maintaining a well-conditioned update direction and leveraging fine-grained noise adaptation.",

Conversational agents powered by large language models (LLMs) with tool integration achieve strong performance on fixed task-oriented dialogue datasets but remain vulnerable to unanticipated, user-induced errors. Rather than focusing on error prevention, this work focuses on error recovery , which necessitates the accurate diagnosis of erroneous dialogue context s and execution of proper recovery plans . Under realistic constraints precluding model fine-tuning or prompt modification due to significant cost and time requirements, we explore whether agents can recover from contextually flawed interactions and how their behavior can be adapted without altering model parameters and prompts. To this end, we propose Reasoning Inception (ReIn), a test-time intervention method that plants an initial reasoning into the agent's decision-making process. Specifically, an external inception module identifies predefined errors within the dialogue context and generates recovery plans , which are subsequently integrated into the agent's internal reasoning process to guide corrective actions, without modifying its parameters or system prompts. We evaluate ReIn by systematically simulating conversational failure scenarios that directly hinder successful completion of user goals: user's ambiguous and unsupported requests. Across diverse combinations of agent models and inception module s, ReIn substantially improves task success and generalizes to unseen error types. Moreover, it consistently outperforms explicit prompt-modification approaches, underscoring its utility as an efficient, on-the-fly method. In-depth analysis of its operational mechanism, particularly in relation to instruction hierarchy, indicates that jointly defining recovery tools with ReIn can serve as a safe and effective strategy for improving the resilience of conversational agents without modifying the backbone models or system prompts.",

Eliciting information to reduce uncertainty about latent group-level properties from surveys and other collective assessments requires allocating limited questioning effort under real costs and missing data. Although large language models enable adaptive, multi-turn interactions in natural language, most existing elicitation methods optimize what to ask with a fixed respondent pool, and do not adapt respondent selection or leverage population structure when responses are partial or incomplete. To address this gap, we study adaptive group elicitation, a multi-round setting where an agent adaptively selects both questions and respondents under explicit query and participation budgets. We propose a theoretically grounded framework that combines (i) an LLM-based expected information gain objective for scoring candidate questions with (ii) heterogeneous graph neural network propagation that aggregates observed responses and participant attributes to impute missing responses and guide per-round respondent selection . This closed-loop procedure queries a small, informative subset of individuals while inferring population-level responses via structured similarity . Across three real-world opinion datasets, our method consistently improves population-level response prediction under constrained budgets, including a >12% relative gain on CES at a 10% respondent budget.",

      "abstract": "LLM-based judges using natural-language rubrics for evaluation can exhibit systematic preference drift from minor rubric modifications, which can be exploited to manipulate alignment pipelines and degrade model performance. Evaluation and alignment pipelines for large language models increasingly rely on LLM-based judges , whose behavior is guided by natural-language rubrics and validated on benchmarks. We identify a previously under-recognized vulnerability in this workflow, which we term Rubric-Induced Preference Drift (RIPD). Even when rubric edits pass benchmark validation , they can still produce systematic and directional shifts in a judge's preferences on target domains. Because rubrics serve as a high-level decision interface, such drift can emerge from seemingly natural, criterion-preserving edits and remain difficult to detect through aggregate benchmark metrics or limited spot-checking. We further show this vulnerability can be exploited through rubric-based preference attacks , in which benchmark-compliant rubric edits steer judgments away from a fixed human or trusted reference on target domains, systematically inducing RIPD and reducing target-domain accuracy up to 9.5% (helpfulness) and 27.9% (harmlessness). When these judgments are used to generate preference labels for downstream post-training , the induced bias propagates through alignment pipelines and becomes internalized in trained policies. This leads to persistent and systematic drift in model behavior . Overall, our findings highlight evaluation rubrics as a sensitive and manipulable control interface, revealing a system-level alignment risk that extends beyond evaluator reliability alone.

Unlike existing approaches that typically decouple motion from geometry or produce limited 4D attributes such as sparse trajectories or two-view scene flow, 4RC learns a holistic 4D representation that jointly captures dense scene geometry and motion dynamics . At its core, 4RC introduces a novel encode-once, query-anywhere and anytime paradigm: a transformer backbone encodes the entire video into a compact spatio-temporal latent space , from which a conditional decoder can efficiently query 3D geometry and motion for any query frame at any target timestamp. To facilitate learning, we represent per-view 4D attributes in a minimally factorized form by decomposing them into base geometry and time-dependent relative motion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that 4RC outperforms prior and concurrent methods across a wide range of 4D reconstruction tasks.",
